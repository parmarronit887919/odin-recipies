    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chapati is an unleavened whole wheat bread that is eaten in India. We love to use it as a wrap.</p>
    <h3>Ingradience</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour and salt together in a bowl. Stir in water to form a soft dough.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead several times. Divide into 8 pieces and roll each into a ball. Roll each ball into a very thin round using a rolling pin.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle over medium-high heat. Cook each dough round on griddle until dough bubbles and blisters appear, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook until lightly browned on the other side.</li>
    </ol>
